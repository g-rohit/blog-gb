### Why Do I Hate BJP?

I hate BJP, probably more than the average person. However, very few people can actually get off of their moral high horse and actually explain why do they hate BJP? 

Again, the answer should be obvious that they’re destroying the economy, radicalizing the youth, while also trying to kill people in broad daylight. However, even after all these things, the amount of hate I have for the BJP and every single one of their supporter, associates or even a remotely linked member is greater than the damage they can ever possibly do. 

To give you a reference, after World War II, even the Nazis were taken up to the Nuremberg trial for sentencing. However, I don’t see any of that happening from my side for the BJP. If I ruled the world, then the things I would do to this party are so, let’s just say not internet friendly for legal reasons, that the direct victims of this party might start feeling bad for them.

So where does this hate originates from? My hate originates from the fact that this single party has destroyed my expectations of what the future of India would look like.

I grew up during a time and in a place where even the news channels weren’t able to talk about racism. I used this example because many people haven’t seen what news channels were like before the Modi-era. They were actually good. 

For example, it wasn’t Zee news or ABP news which was getting triggered about things related to India. In fact, it was NDTV. Years ago, BBC Top Gear had done a series on India which was quite “on the nose” to be honest, but it was still funny. And one nice evening, an English news Anchor on the NDTV was discussing about how damaging it is to India’s global image. 

If it isn’t an example of “times have changed” then I don’t know what it. Coming back to my point of what I thought India’s future would be, I thought that the future would consist of me doing things as an adult which I deemed cool when I was a child.

These things included earning money, driving a lot, playing a lot of video games and most importantly, not worrying about the stupid politics which is happening around the world.

I never wanted to worry about minority rights or reservations or India’s education budget. All I wanted was to live my damn life the way I saw fit. But no.. Along came the BJP and my hope of a stress-free future vanished away.

See I don’t care about the children begging on the streets as much as the next guy. But when you’re talking about putting those children in jail just because they have no birth certificate, which they probably don’t, then I can’t help but aggressively ask the question “Yo. What the fuck is wrong with you?”

BJP has infiltrated so deep into my life before making any sizeable investment I need to think twice whether India will remain a democratic country up until that point or not. 
And it is not the divisions which BJP sows in the society that troubles me, I am as cool as you when it comes to race and sex-based discrimination, however, what troubles me is the fact that BJP embodies every aspect of a communist party while pretending to not be it.

BJP is actually a communist party. If you don’t believe me, then let us try measuring BJP to some of the principles to a right-wing party and check the result. 

A right-wing government believes in a free-market, something which BJP absolutely does not believes in. A good example of this is an FDI brought by the BJP to prevent foreign companies like Flipkart and Amazon from keeping more than 25% of their own-manufactured goods in their inventory. Which indirectly benefitted corporations like Reliance in their Reliance Trends and Goods store.

So BJP benefits its corporate overlords while claiming to be neutral in the free market. Got it.

The next point of a right-wing government is minimum government. A right-wing government would interfere as little in your daily life as possible. BJP interferes as much as it can in your life. Furthermore, after the release of the Data Protection Bill, BJP will have the power to swoop in your private conversations if it gets the hint that you’re talking bad stuff about them.

The official document actually said the government would do so in the name of “public interest” and “greater good of the nation.” But in a country where FIR is touted as the right of every citizen and yet most policemen never register it, you can make out for your self what a vague term as “public interest” would mean. 

The third point of a right-wing government is a stronger state. A strong state has strong institutions. And we all know what BJP does to its own institutions.

I wonder which other countries benefit certain companies and restricts freedom of speech. Since a lot of you mouth-breathers don’t understand sarcasm, only China and Russia, the two pseudo commie state-capitalist countries do such a thing.

What pains me are the lies and people, like swine, indulging themselves in it like it was the truth, while simultaneously forcing me to accept their lie as my truth. 

So to sum it up. BJP is actually a communist government hell-bent on authoritarianism but has somehow managed to fool 1.2 billion people into thinking that they are doing something good.
